# hi there!

I'm jdb8, otherwise known as jbateson, otherwise known as Joe. 

I live in San Francisco and work at Yelp as a full-stack developer on the Webcore team, exploring various aspects of web infra. My interests include eating, sleeping, and turning coffee into code (LOL). 

Check out my little sidebar thing to find out more about me! Bye!
